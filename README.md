Title: Makes me think there was no quality testing of these recipes
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2014
Review: I'm very disappointed with this book. I've had very bad luck with the recipes I've tried, and I now believe they are systemic to the book.

The first recipe I tried was for Classic French Bread (p.54). It was terrible. Very chewy, and a very bad consistency overall. Flavor wasn't great either. It was nothing like any French Bread I've ever had from the bakery, and I followed the instructions exactly.

Today, I tried the very first recipe in the book, All Occasion White Bread (p.24). I tried to make the two pound loaf version, and again, I followed the directions exactly (and I re-read them before making this post... I definitely left nothing out). I've done enough bread machine baking using online recipes from allrecipes.com, from other bread machine books and from the machine guide to know that generally a two pound loaf of white bread requires four cups of bread flour. This called for three and a half, but I thought I'd give it a shot since that's what the book said. I came back 30 minutes later and found liquidy soup in the bottom of the machine. It was not even remotely close to being able to form a dough ball. So I reset the machine and measured in another 1/4 cup of flour. Not enough. So I put in another 1/4 cup. Close, but still too tacky for a normal bread ball. So I added in a couple more spoonfuls and then things were about right. So despite the recipe calling for 3.5 cups, I put in 4 cups plus a couple spoonfuls, which perfectly matched my intuition. And only then did it form a bread ball.

Another bizarre thing about this book is that many recipes such as this one call for the same amount of yeast as the 1.5 pound version, whether you make the 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 pound version of the loaf. I've never seen any recipe anywhere else say that you can use the same small amount of yeast whether you are making a 1.5 or 3 pound loaf, and still expect the same results. I've not finished baking my 2 lb All Occasion White Bread recipe yet, but if it rises correctly it's probably only because it just got an extra half an hour of yeast growing time, thanks to me having to add all that flour and reset the machine.

The only decent experience I've had with this book so far is that when I made the 1.5 lb version of the All Occasion White, it turned out pretty well. Nothing better than the many white bread recipes online, but not worse either.

But on the whole, when I have multiple bad recipes in the "classics" section at the front of the book, which presumably should have gotten the most testing, I have to conclude they probably weren't really tested at all. And calling for the same amount of yeast in the same size of loaf doesn't instill me with confidence, even though the authors make a point of saying it works. If I could still return the book I would, but it's been too long and I can't. So I guess I may try a few more recipes and I'll possibly revise the rating up a little if I find some good ones, but at this point, I'm not even sure it deserves one star if it's that far off the mark on flour quantity on the very first recipe in the book.

And as a note, I am using a 2-3 year old late model Breadman bread machine that makes some very good bread from most recipes, so I know it's not my machine. Lack of flour caused the soupiness, not anything mechanical. I'd steer clear of this and go for the Bread Machine Magic cookbook instead: http://www.amazon.com/Bread-Machine-Magic-Revised-Edition/dp/031230496X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1395003746&sr=8-5&keywords=bread+machine+cookbooks. I haven't liked the flavor of every recipe in Bread Machine Magic, but that's fairly normal since no one has the same tastes. At least all the recipes I've tried seem very normal and dependable, and I've never had anything come out way off, as I have in this book multiple times now.

Title: Great Variety
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2010
Review: I had purchased a bread machine two years ago and with my hectic schedule, I never had the opportunity to even take the Zojirushi Home Bakery Supreme out of the box. Sad, but true. Finally, I wanted to buy cookbooks to show me how to use my machine and to produce bread and not a brick (part of my fear and the reason I never took the machine out of the box). Being new to bread making, I wanted to start off with a method that seemed a little easier to me, with a machine. This cookbook has helped to give me guidelines for recipes, ideas for trying flavors I may not have considered, and a look into sour dough. I like the dark black type on the white pages, easy to see. This has been a good starter book for me as the recipes haven't seemed too difficult. The recipes I have tried have not come out "too wet" like another reviewer suggest. I can honestly say I would rather have too wet than too dry. It's easier for me to sprinkle in more bread flour during the first five minutes of kneading than it is to keep adding water until the dough is moist enough. One must realize that water is not necessarily the only "wet" ingredient utilized in a recipe. Adding more water to a dry dough could potentially make a dense or flavorless loaf, in my opinion. Humidity also could affect wetness or dryness of a loaf, not necessarily the original recipe. I have found bread making is an art which requires many modifications for multiple conditions.

Title: Awesome Cookbook!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2013
Review: I have bought several bread machine cookbooks over the years but by far this is my favorite. Just a wonderful variety of breads from the basic to interesting combinations of ingredients I would never have thought of. The key to baking a successful loaf of bread is sometimes a little trial and error. A bread recipe is only a starting point. A lot of factors can influence the outcome such as the type of bread machiine, type/brand flour, freshness of the yeast, altitude, humidity levels, etc. I can bake bread using the same exact recipe but if I bake it in the summer when it is really humid I usually need to add more flour as opposed to when I bake in the winter when the air is much drier. The approach that has worked for me is to first try the recipe as written keeping an eye on the consistency of the dough as it is mixing. Looks too runny, add more flour, too dry, add more water until the consistency is correct. I make notes on the page as to what I did so I can replicate it the next time. After trying the bread I will add more notes to the page such as: use more yeast, less sugar, try shallots instead of onion, etc. Using a bread machine to bake bread is so convenient and this cookbook makes it really fun.

Title: Very complete first bread machine book !
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2013
Review: This book is great for anything you can think of to make with a bread machine. Ton of easy to follow recipes and explains terms . and has helpful tips to make your bread, cakes, cookies that help them be a success! Did you know that bread machines use "bread flour"? I didn't. I always used common baking flour and thought that would be acceptable. It explains different settings on your machine and how to use them and helps you understand common terms when baking with your machine...not to mention the full range of recipes to try out. I have not tried any of them yet...but they certainly sound delicious! It is a great book for the beginner bread machine baker....or the seasoned baker. Anyone would very pleased to add this book to their cook book library for easy to follow recipes that sound amazing! Item also arrived quickly and was well packaged and is in very good condition. I thank the seller for their efforts in making this transaction well worth my time and money!
